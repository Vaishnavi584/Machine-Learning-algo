A machine learning algorithm is a computational method that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. These algorithms analyze patterns in data to improve their performance over time. They can be categorized into several types, including:

Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on labeled data, where the input-output pairs are known. It learns to map inputs to the correct outputs (e.g., regression, classification).

Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm works with unlabeled data to identify patterns or groupings within the data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).

Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties to improve its decision-making over time.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in machine learning is a critical step that involves analyzing and summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset before applying any machine learning models. The primary goals of EDA include:

Understanding Data Structure: Identifying the types of data, such as numerical, categorical, or time series.

Identifying Patterns and Relationships: Finding correlations between variables and understanding their distributions.

Detecting Anomalies and Outliers: Spotting unusual data points that could affect model performance.

Assessing Data Quality: Checking for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Visualizations: Using plots and graphs (like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots) to visually interpret data distributions and relationships.

Overall, EDA helps to inform the choice of models and preprocessing steps, leading to better machine learning outcomes.

Linear regression in machine learning is a technique for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. Here’s a concise overview:
Key Points:
Types:
Simple Linear Regression: Involves one feature (independent variable) and one target (dependent variable).
Multiple Linear Regression: Involves multiple features to predict a single target variable.
Training: The model is trained using a dataset to find the best-fitting line by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between predicted and actual values (Ordinary Least Squares).
Assumptions:
Linearity: The relationship between predictors and the target is linear.
Independence: The residuals (errors) are independent.
Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of the residuals.
Normality: Residuals are normally distributed.
Evaluation Metrics: Common metrics include R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess model performance.


LAB3 :
Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, where the outcome is a categorical variable (typically 0 or 1). Here’s a brief overview:
Key Points:
Purpose: It predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a specific class.
Output: Instead of predicting a continuous value, it outputs a probability between 0 and 1, which can be converted into a binary outcome using a threshold (commonly 0.5).
Assumptions:
Assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the log-odds of the outcome.
Requires independence of observations and no multicollinearity among predictors.
Evaluation Metrics: Common metrics for assessing performance include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).


LAB4:
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used primarily for classification tasks, but it can also be applied to regression. Here’s a brief overview:

Key Points:
Purpose: SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space.

Support Vectors: The algorithm identifies the data points closest to the hyperplane (support vectors), which are crucial for defining the decision boundary.

Kernel Trick: SVM can handle non-linear classification using kernel functions (like polynomial or radial basis function) to transform the data into higher dimensions where a linear separation is possible.

Regularization: It includes a regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors.

Applications: SVM is effective in various fields, including image recognition, text classification, and bioinformatics, due to its robustness in high-dimensional spaces.



LAB5:
A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. Here’s a brief overview:

Key Points:
Structure: Decision trees represent decisions and their possible consequences as a tree-like model, consisting of nodes (representing features), branches (representing decision rules), and leaves (representing outcomes).

Decision Making: The tree splits the data based on feature values, making decisions at each node to separate the data into subsets that are more homogeneous.

Criteria for Splitting: Common criteria for determining the best splits include Gini impurity, entropy (for classification), and mean squared error (for regression).

Interpretability: Decision trees are easy to understand and interpret, making them useful for visualizing decision processes.

Limitations: They can be prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees. Techniques like pruning, ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forests), or setting a maximum depth can help mitigate this.
SVM is known for its effectiveness in both linear and non-linear classification tasks and its ability to work well with complex datasets.
